# Mastering ML using Scikit learn
Activities:
1. A template file capturing complete ML process compiled based on the SKlearn documentation. Done!
2. How to select ML algorithms guidelines?
  2.1.   Use the diagram here to select an estimator for the problem. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html
3. How to use inbuild datasets?
  3.1. An example is captured in the template file.  
4. Create an example ML example covering the questions above!
  4.1. Captures this using the inbuilt iris dataset. 
5. Optimise the model with parameters.
  5.1. Template file covers this.
6. Work on exercises form sklearn.
  6.1 This is captured in some other files. However, this is treated as optional. Next phases of this work would involve using a raw data set from kaggle and create do machine learning on it. This would involve end to end cleaning up of data set and having an optimised model.
7. To have a complete picture of this library, complete the rest of tutorials including text analytics.
